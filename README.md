# Everyday Challenges

This is the app demonstrating my Everyday coding challenges.
Check it out here: [Jesse Wei's Everyday Challenges](https://challenges.jessewei.jp/)

## Why

This project is inspired by projects like [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). As I am not confident in my persistence, I decided to go for 30 days first.

## What

After using Javascript frameworks like ReactJS and VueJs for a few years, recently I feel a drive to go back to the basics and get a deeper understanding of Javascript as a language. The book, Eloquent Javascript, covers a wide ranges of interesting topics and can be read online instantly, so I decided to study this book and start my challenges by doing the exercises at the end of each chapter.

## How

I am currently doing one exercise per day but at a high level. I am not satisfied by just getting the expected output and instead, I will evaluate the solution's performance and readability and think if there are other or better solutions. This way, my challenges stay manageable enough to increase my chance of persisting while at the same time help me improve my coding skills effectively.
