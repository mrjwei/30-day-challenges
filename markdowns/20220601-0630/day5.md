# Day 5: Todo App Tutorial & Game Architecture

Today, I completed two tasks:

1. I found mockapi I tried yesterday still has some limitations on working with nested resources efficiently, so I moved to a hosted db with express.js backend. The reason for the choice is that hosted databases are more production-oriented and express.js works with [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), a powerful ORE tool for node.js and typescript, well.
2. I designed basic architecture for a game I'm considering building.
