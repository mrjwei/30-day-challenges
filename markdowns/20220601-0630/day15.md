# Day 15: Todo App Tutorial: Refactoring & JS Date Time Formatting Post Drafting

I've been busy setting up working environment for my coming remote dev job since yesterday and barely managed to continue my coding challenges. But I still made a couple progresses.

- I did some refactoring on the frontend of the todo app so that components which should've been componentized got componentized properly and unused code got removed.
- I did some exploration about the `Date` and `Intl` objects of Javascript and drafted a related post on [dev.to](https://dev.to/).

## What I Learned Today

I've used `moment.js` a few times before to work with date, time and date-time strings. But as my exploration of Javascript's `Date` object and other related objects and APIs went on, I started to feel I could build a similar library myself. The ideas behind libraries like `moment.js` became clearer and I really enjoyed my learning.
