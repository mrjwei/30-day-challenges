# Day 1: Challenge-Showcasing Site Redesign

After an intesive week busy with my day job, I returned back to my challenges today with a new 30-day block.

Today, I redesigned my challenge-showcasing site (this one) in order to:

- Adapt to my need for holding multiple 30-day blocks in the future.
- Improve readability and user experience by getting rid of redundant elements, colors and other visual noises.

Here is a side-by-side comparison:
