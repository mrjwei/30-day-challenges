# Day 10: Todo App Tutorial: Backend (Session)

Today, I introduced express-session to the backend of the todo app and created relevant content of this step for the tutorial.

## Things Learned Today

- The `process` object of Node.js has a `nextTick` method that ensures the function passed to it is invoked at the end of current event loop and before the next event loop.
- `passport.js` has a `serializeUser` and a `deserializeUser` method that serializes the login user information and deserializes it for use in the app respectively.
