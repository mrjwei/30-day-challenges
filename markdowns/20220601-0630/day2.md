# Day 2: EJS Book: A Robot Project

Today I spent about 2 hours working on the _robot project_ of the EJS book. It's basically a graph algorithm project and I find it pretty interesting, though not at all easy to learn.

It went well up until the dynamically updating State class, but concepts started to get much harder to understand after that. I'll spend more time absorbing those tomorrow.
