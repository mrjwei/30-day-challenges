# Day 4: Todo App Tutorial: MockAPI

I've been creating frontend content for the tutorial since yesterday. I particularly focused on exploring [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/projects) as a development API before the backend is fully scaffolded today.

I used [json server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) before and quite like its simplicity, but it also comes with some limitations like difficulty in working with nested resources.

MockAPI, on the other hand, has the same simplicity but a lot easier to work with nested resources. One thing that I like MockAPI most is its ability to generate large sets of data instantly. This way, I don't need to manually create data which is inefficient.
