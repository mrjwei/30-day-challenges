# Day 23: Handy Todo: A Truly Handy App to Manage Your Life (Architecture & UI Design)

I started this app project a week ago in order to get familiar with Vue 3 Composition API and it was a pretty simple SPA at first. But a lot of ideas struck me as the project went on and finally I decided to take it many steps further to test out authentication, Nodejs API, Postgresql, Prisma and so on.

To prepare to integrate more features mentioned above, I reviewed the architecture and UI design of the app today.

## Architecture

This is a simplified demonstration of the architecture of the app.

## UI

This image shows part of the UI of the app. I started the app from *phase 1* and I'm working on *phase 2* now. There will be a *phase 3* that focuses mainly on improving UX.
